### Configuration

This project likely requires configuration for Supabase and OpenAI.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2.  Add your environment variables, for example:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

### Running the Project

To start the development server:
